# Armstrong-Number
What is Armstrong Number? An n-digit number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the nth powers of the digits is equal to the number itself.  For example, let's take the number 407. (4^3)+ (0^3)+(7^3) = 64+0+343 = 407. This shows that the number 407 is an armstrong number.  Let's also look at the number 1342. (1^4)+(3^4)+(4^4)+(2^4) =1+81+256+16=354 is not an armstrong number because it is not equal to 1342.  1634=1^4+6^4+3^4+4^4=1+1296+81+256=1634  54748=5^5+4^5+7^5+4^5+8^5=3125+1024+16807+1024+32768=54748
